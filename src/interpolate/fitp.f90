    !  given the set of data points (x(i),y(i)) and the set of positive
    !  numbers w(i),i=1,2,...,m-1, subroutine percur determines a smooth
    !  periodic spline approximation of degree k with period per=x(m)-x(1).
    !  if iopt=-1 percur calculates the weighted least-squares periodic
    !  spline according to a given set of knots.
    !  if iopt>=0 the number of knots of the spline s(x) and the position
    !  t(j),j=1,2,...,n is chosen automatically by the routine. the smooth-
    !  ness of s(x) is then achieved by minimalizing the discontinuity
    !  jumps of the k-th derivative of s(x) at the knots t(j),j=k+2,k+3,...,
    !  n-k-1. the amount of smoothness is determined by the condition that
    !  f(p)=sum((w(i)*(y(i)-s(x(i))))**2) be <= s, with s a given non-
    !  negative constant, called the smoothing factor.
    !  the fit s(x) is given in the b-spline representation (b-spline coef-
    !  ficients c(j),j=1,2,...,n-k-1) and can be evaluated by means of
    !  subroutine splev.

    !             ive tolerance set to 0.001 by the program.
    !    ier=-1 : normal return. the spline returned is an interpolating
    !             periodic spline (fp=0).
    !    ier=-2 : normal return. the spline returned is the weighted least-
    !             squares constant. in this extreme case fp gives the upper
    !             bound fp0 for the smoothing factor s.
    !    ier=1  : error. the required storage space exceeds the available
    !             storage space, as specified by the parameter nest.
    !             probably causes : nest too small. if nest is already
    !             large (say nest > m/2), it may also indicate that s is
    !             too small
    !             the approximation returned is the least-squares periodic
    !             spline according to the knots t(1),t(2),...,t(n). (n=nest)
    !             the parameter fp gives the corresponding weighted sum of
    !             squared residuals (fp>s).
    !    ier=2  : error. a theoretically impossible result was found during
    !             the iteration process for finding a smoothing spline with
    !             fp = s. probably causes : s too small.
    !             there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
    !             weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
    !             condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
    !    ier=3  : error. the maximal number of iterations maxit (set to 20
    !             by the program) allowed for finding a smoothing spline
    !             with fp=s has been reached. probably causes : s too small
    !             there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
    !             weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
    !             condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
    !    ier=10 : error. on entry, the input data are controlled on validity
    !             the following restrictions must be satisfied.

    !                       xx(j) = x(i) or x(i)+(x(m)-x(1)) such that
    !                         t(j) < xx(j) < t(j+k+1), j=k+1,...,n-k-1

    !                         if s=0 : nest >= m+2*k
    !             if one of these conditions is found to be violated,control
    !             is immediately repassed to the calling program. in that
    !             case there is no approximation returned.
    !
    !  further comments:
    !   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff
    !   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.
    !   if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be
    !   lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in
    !   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating periodic
    !   spline if s=0 and the weighted least-squares constant if s is very
    !   large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result in
    !   a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit.
    !   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is
    !   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits
    !   graphically.
    !   recommended values for s depend on the weights w(i). if these are
    !   taken as 1/d(i) with d(i) an estimate of the standard deviation of
    !   y(i), a good s-value should be found in the range (m-sqrt(2*m),m+
    !   sqrt(2*m)). if nothing is known about the statistical error in y(i)
    !   each w(i) can be set equal to one and s determined by trial and
    !   error, taking account of the comments above. the best is then to
    !   start with a very large value of s ( to determine the least-squares
    !   constant and the corresponding upper bound fp0 for s) and then to
    !   progressively decrease the value of s ( say by a factor 10 in the
    !   beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10, fp0/100,...and more carefully as the
    !   approximation shows more detail) to obtain closer fits.
    !   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with
    !   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or
    !   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user
    !   must set iopt=0.
    !   if iopt=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found at
    !   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation
    !   time if percur is called repeatedly for different values of s.
    !   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will
    !   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the
    !   function underlying the data. but, if the computation mode iopt=1
    !   is used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at
    !   previous calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number
    !   of trials with different s-values and iopt=1, the user can finally
    !   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call
    !   percur once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt=0.
    !   indeed, percur may then return an approximation of the same quality
    !   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction
    !   is also an important objective for the user.

    !             if one of these conditions is found to be violated,control
    !             is immediately repassed to the calling program. in that
    !             case there is no approximation returned.
    !
    !  further comments:
    !   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff
    !   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.
    !   if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be
    !   lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in
    !   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating spline if
    !   s=0 and the weighted least-squares polynomial of degree k if s is
    !   very large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result
    !   in a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit.
    !   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is
    !   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits
    !   graphically.
    !   recommended values for s depend on the weights w(i). if these are
    !   taken as 1/d(i) with d(i) an estimate of the standard deviation of
    !   y(i), a good s-value should be found in the range (m-sqrt(2*m),m+
    !   sqrt(2*m)). if nothing is known about the statistical error in y(i)
    !   each w(i) can be set equal to one and s determined by trial and
    !   error, taking account of the comments above. the best is then to
    !   start with a very large value of s ( to determine the least-squares
    !   polynomial and the corresponding upper bound fp0 for s) and then to
    !   progressively decrease the value of s ( say by a factor 10 in the
    !   beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10, fp0/100,...and more carefully as the
    !   approximation shows more detail) to obtain closer fits.
    !   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with
    !   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or
    !   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user
    !   must set iopt=0.
    !   if iopt=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found at
    !   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation
    !   time if curfit is called repeatedly for different values of s.
    !   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will
    !   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the
    !   function underlying the data. but, if the computation mode iopt=1
    !   is used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at
    !   previous calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number
    !   of trials with different s-values and iopt=1, the user can finally
    !   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call
    !   curfit once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt=0.
    !   indeed, curfit may then return an approximation of the same quality
    !   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction
    !   is also an important objective for the user.

    !  the interior knots t(k+2),...t(n-k-1) must be zero. the corres-     c
    !  ponding weights of these additional rows are set to 1/p.            c
    !  iteratively we then have to determine the value of p such that f(p),c
    !  the sum of squared residuals be = s. we already know that the least-c
    !  squares polynomial curve corresponds to p=0, and that the least-    c
    !  squares periodic spline curve corresponds to p=infinity. the        c
    !  iteration process which is proposed here, makes use of rational     c
    !  interpolation. since f(p) is a convex and strictly decreasing       c
    !  function of p, it can be approximated by a rational function        c

    !  we have determined the number of knots and their position.          c
    !  we now compute the b-spline coefficients of the smoothing spline    c
    !  sp(x). the observation matrix a is extended by the rows of matrix   c
    !  b expressing that the kth derivative discontinuities of sp(x) at    c
    !  the interior knots t(k+2),...t(n-k-1) must be zero. the corres-     c
    !  ponding weights of these additional rows are set to 1/sqrt(p).      c
    !  iteratively we then have to determine the value of p such that      c
    !  f(p)=sum(w(i)*(y(i)-sp(x(i)))**2) be = s. we already know that      c
    !  the least-squares constant function corresponds to p=0, and that    c
    !  the least-squares periodic spline corresponds to p=infinity. the    c
    !  iteration process which is proposed here, makes use of rational     c
    !  interpolation. since f(p) is a convex and strictly decreasing       c
    !  function of p, it can be approximated by a rational function        c
    !  r(p) = (u*p+v)/(p+w). three values of p(p1,p2,p3) with correspond-  c
    !  ing values of f(p) (f1=f(p1)-s,f2=f(p2)-s,f3=f(p3)-s) are used      c
    !  to calculate the new value of p such that r(p)=s. convergence is    c
    !  guaranteed by taking f1>0 and f3<0.                                 c
