!! Description: @ref submodule-integrate
!!
!! ## From QUADPACK original paper:
!!
!! ### Introduction
!!
!! QUADPACK is a Fortran subroutine package for the numerical computation of definite one-dimensional integrals.
!! It originated from a joint project of R. Piessens and E. de Doncker
!! (Appl.  Math. and Progr. Div.- K.U.Leuven, Belgium),
!! C. Ueberhuber (Inst.  Fuer Math.-Techn.U.Wien, Austria),
!! and D. Kahaner (Nation. Bureau of Standards- Washington D.C., U.S.A.).
!!
!! All routines calculate approximations \f$J\f$ to integrals
!! \f[ J \approx I := \int_{a}^{b} f(x, args) dx \f]
!! or integrals of weighted functions:
!! \f[ J \approx I := \int_{a}^{b} f(x) W(x) dx \f]
!! hopefully satisfying error conditions given by the user (epsabs, epsrel)
!!   \f[ || I - J || \le \max ( \mathrm{epsabs}, \mathrm{epsrel} \cdot ||I|| ). \f]
!!
!! ### Guidelines for the use of QUADPACK
!!
!!  Here it is not our purpose to investigate the question when
!!  automatic quadrature should be used. we shall rather attempt
!!  to help the user who already made the decision to use quadpack,
!!  with selecting an appropriate routine or a combination of
!!  several routines for handling his problem.
!!
!!  For both quadrature over finite and over infinite intervals,
!!  one of the first questions to be answered by the user is
!!  related to the amount of computer time he wants to spend,
!!  versus his -own- time which would be needed, for example, for
!!  manual subdivision of the interval or other analytic
!!  manipulations.
!!
!!  1. The user may not care about computer time, or not be
!!      willing to do any analysis of the problem. especially when
!!      only one or a few integrals must be calculated, this attitude
!!      can be perfectly reasonable. in this case it is clear that
!!      either the most sophisticated of the routines for finite
!!      intervals, qags, must be used, or its analogue for infinite
!!      intervals, qagi. these routines are able to cope with
!!      rather difficult, even with improper integrals.
!!      this way of proceeding may be expensive. but the integrator
!!      is supposed to give you an answer in return, with additional
!!      information in the case of a failure, through its error
!!      estimate and flag. yet it must be stressed that the programs
!!      cannot be totally reliable.
!!
!!  2. The user may want to examine the integrand function.
!!      if bad local difficulties occur, such as a discontinuity, a
!!      singularity, derivative singularity or high peak at one or
!!      more points within the interval, the first advice is to
!!      split up the interval at these points. the integrand must
!!      then be examinated over each of the subintervals separately,
!!      so that a suitable integrator can be selected for each of
!!      them. if this yields problems involving relative accuracies
!!      to be imposed on -finite- subintervals, one can make use of
!!      qagp, which must be provided with the positions of the local
!!      difficulties. however, if strong singularities are present
!!      and a high accuracy is requested, application of qags on the
!!      subintervals may yield a better result.
!!
!!    for quadrature over finite intervals we thus dispose of qags
!!    and
!!    - qng for well-behaved integrands,
!!    - qag for functions with an oscillating behavior of a non
!!      specific type,
!!    - qawo for functions, eventually singular, containing a
!!      factor cos(omega*x) or sin(omega*x) where omega is known,
!!    - qaws for integrands with algebraico-logarithmic end point
!!      singularities of known type,
!!    - qawc for cauchy principal values.
!!
!!    @remark
!!      On return, the info type `[d|c]_qp_extra` in the last argument
!!    adaptive integrators contain information about the interval
!!    subdivision process and hence about the integrand behavior:
!!    the end points of the subintervals, the local integral
!!    contributions and error estimates, and eventually other
!!    characteristics. for this reason, and because of its simple
!!    globally adaptive nature, the routine qag in particular is
!!    well-suited for integrand examination. difficult spots can
!!    be located by investigating the error estimates on the
!!    subintervals.
!!
!!    for infinite intervals we provide only one general-purpose
!!    routine, qagi. it is based on the qags algorithm applied
!!    after a transformation of the original interval into (0,1).
!!    yet it may eventuate that another type of transformation is
!!    more appropriate, or one might prefer to break up the
!!    original interval and use qagi only on the infinite part
!!    and so on. these kinds of actions suggest a combined use of
!!    different quadpack integrators. note that, when the only
!!    difficulty is an integrand singularity at the finite
!!    integration limit, it will in general not be necessary to
!!    break up the interval, as qagi deals with several types of
!!    singularity at the boundary point of the integration range.
!!    it also handles slowly convergent improper integrals, on
!!    the condition that the integrand does not oscillate over
!!    the entire infinite interval. if it does we would advise
!!    to sum succeeding positive and negative contributions to
!!    the integral -e.g. integrate between the zeros- with one
!!    or more of the finite-range integrators, and apply
!!    convergence acceleration eventually by means of quadpack
!!    subroutine qext which implements the epsilon algorithm.
!!    such quadrature problems include the fourier transform as
!!    a special case. yet for the latter we have an automatic
!!    integrator available, qawf.
!!
!! ## How to decide what routine to use.
!!
!! ### If your integration region is finite:
!!
!! - If you can factor the integrand as \f$ f(x)=W(x)g(x)\f$, where \f$g(x) \f$ is smooth on [A,B] and \f$ W(x)=\cos(\omega x)\f$ or \f$ W(x)= \sin(\omega x) \f$ then use [qawo()](@ref quadpack::qawo).
!! - Otherwise, if you can factor \f$f(x)=W(x) g(x)\f$ where \f$g(x)\f$ is smooth and
!! \f$ W(x)=(x-a)^{\alpha} (b-x)^{\beta}  (\log(x-a))^L  (\log(b-x))^K  \f$
!! with \f$K, L = 0\f$ or 1, and \f$ \alpha, \beta > -1 \f$, then use  [qaws()](@ref quadpack::qaws).
!! - Otherwise, if you can factor \f$ f(x)=W(x)g(x)\f$, where \f$g(x) \f$ is smooth and \f$ W(x)=1/(x-c)\f$ for some constant c, use [qawc()](@ref quadpack::qawc).
!! - Otherwise, if you do not care too much about possible inefficient use of computer time, and do not want to further analyze the problem, use [qags()](@ref quadpack::qags).
!! - Otherwise, if the integrand is smooth, use [qng()](@ref quadpack::qng) or [qag()](@ref quadpack::qag).
!! - Otherwise, if there are discontinuities or singularities of the integrand or of its derivative, and you know where they are, split the integration range at these points and analyze each subinterval. You can also use `qagp`, which is to be provided with the x-locations of the singularities or discontinuities.
!! - Otherwise, if the integrand has end point singularities, use `qags`.
!! - Otherwise, if the integrand has an oscillatory behavior of nonspecific type, and no singularities, use [qag()](@ref quadpack::qag) with rule="qk61".
!! - Otherwise, use  [qags()](@ref quadpack::qags).
!!
!! ### Routines for an infinite region:
!!
!! - If the integrand decays rapidly to zero, truncate the interval and use the finite interval decision tree.
!! - Otherwise, if the integrand oscillates over the entire infinite range, and the integral is a Fourier transform, use `qawf`.
!! - Or, if the integrand oscillates over the entire infinite range, but is not a Fourier transform, then sum the successive positive and negative contributions by integrating between the zeroes of the integrand. Apply convergence acceleration with `qextr`.
!! - Otherwise, if you are not constrained by computer time, and do not wish to analyze the problem further, use `qagi`.
!! - Otherwise, if the integrand has a non-smooth behavior in the range, and you know where it occurs, split off these regions and use the appropriate finite range routines to integrate over them. Then begin this tree again to handle the remainder of the region.
!! - Otherwise, truncation of the interval, or application of a suitable transformation for reducing the problem to a finite range may be possible. And you may also call `qagi`.
!!
!! ## @anchor integrable Integrable functions
!! All routines described here may integrate functions with one of the following signatures:
!!
!! * real function `f(x)` of a real argument `x`
!! * complex function `f(x)` of a real argument `x`
!! * real function `f(x,args)` of real arguments `x`, and array `args`
!! * complex function `f(x,args)` of real arguments `x`, and array `args`
!!
!! For functions that need extra arguments besides the integration variable `x`, the argument array must be passed to the integration routines.
!!
!! There is also the possibility of using
!! `type(nf_rfunction)` for real functions or
!! `type(nf_cfunction)` for complex functions
!!

  !! This is a simple globally adaptive integrator using the strategy of Aind (Piessens,

  !! divided into subintervals, and on each iteration the subinterval with the largest estimated error
  !! is bisected. This reduces the overall error rapidly, as the subintervals become concentrated
  !! around local difficulties in the integrand.  It is possible to choose between 6 pairs of
  !! Gauss-Kronrod quadrature formulae for the rule evaluation component.  The pairs of high degree of
  !! precision are suitable for handling integration difficulties due to a strongly oscillating
  !! integrand.

  !!
  !! @remarks (from
  !! [gsl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/integration.html#qags-adaptive-integration-with-singularities))
  !! The presence of an integrable singularity in the integration region causes an adaptive routine to
  !! concentrate new subintervals around the singularity. As the subintervals decrease in size the
  !! successive approximations to the integral converge in a limiting fashion. This approach to the
  !! limit can be accelerated using an extrapolation procedure. The QAGS algorithm combines adaptive
  !! bisection with the Wynn epsilon-algorithm to speed-up the integration of many types of integrable
  !! singularities.
  !!
  !! Either or both limits of integration may be infinite.
  !! By default it uses a Gauss-Kronrod rule of 21 points for finite limits.
  !!
  !! For infinite limits use [nf_minf](@ref basic::nf_minf) for "minus infinite" and [nf_inf](@ref basic::nf_inf) for "plus infinite". A 15-points Gauss-Kronrod rule will be used by default but it will be overriden by the argument `gkrule`.
  !!
  !! The integration over the semi-infinite interval \f$(a,+\infty)\f$ is performed by means of the mapping
  !! \f$x = a + (1-t)/t\f$, onto the semi-open interval \f$(0,1]\f$.
  !!
  !! \f[
  !! \int_{a}^{+\infty} dx f(x) = \int_0^1 dt f(a + (1-t)/t)/t^2
  !! \f]
  !!
  !! The integration over the semi-infinite interval \f$(-\infty, b)\f$ is performed by means of the mapping
  !! \f$x = b - (1-t)/t\f$, onto the semi-open interval \f$(0,1]\f$.
  !!
  !! \f[
  !! \int_{-\infty}^{b} dx f(x) = \int_0^1 dt f(b - (1-t)/t)/t^2
  !! \f]
  !!
  !! The integral over the infinite interval \f$(-\infty,+\infty)\f$ is performed combining the two methods before, i.e: mapping \f$x = (1-t)/t\f$ onto the semi-open interval \f$(0,1]\f$
  !! \f[\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dx f(x)=\int_0^1 dt\Big(f((1 - t) / t) + f(-(1 - t) / t) \Big) / t^2.\f]

  !!@note As explained in
  !! [gsl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/integration.html#qags-adaptive-integration-with-singularities),
  !! the adaptive bisection algorithm of QAG is used, with modifications to ensure that subdivisions
  !! do not occur at the singular point \f$x = c\f$.  When a subinterval contains the point \f$x =
  !! c\f$ or is close to it then a special 25-point modified Clenshaw-Curtis rule is used to control
  !! the singularity.  Further away from the singularity the algorithm uses an ordinary 15-point
  !! Gauss-Kronrod integration rule.
